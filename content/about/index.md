Hello! I'm Genevieve, a passionate full-stack software engineer with a knack for creating seamless digital experiences. Whether it's developing robust back-end systems or crafting elegant front-end interfaces, I love to bring ideas to life through code.

But software engineering is just one side of the coin for me. When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, you'll often find me indulging in my other [creative pursuits]({{< ref "hobby" >}}).
