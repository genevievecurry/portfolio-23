As a generalist, I like to explore different media. It's fun to experiment with different styles, techniques, and new tools. A few examples I've included here range from quick illustrations to art that required multiple sessions to complete. Art tagged `Inktober`, for example, would have a short time constraint.

You can find these, and more, on Instagram at [@g_the_notbot](https://www.instagram.com/g_the_notbot/), although it's not updated frequently at this point.
